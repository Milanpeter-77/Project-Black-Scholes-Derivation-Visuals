# Visualising Black-Scholes Derivation

This repository contains the supporting material for a short theoretical paper on the derivation.

## Repository structure

- `visuals-script.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter notebook that generates all visualisations, plots, and annotated derivation steps for the paper.
- `bs-derivation.pdf`  
  The printed version of the derivation, including visual elements produced by the notebook.

## Contents at a glance

- Step-by-step derivation of the Black–Scholes PDE via Ito’s Lemma, risk-neutral valuation, and boundary conditions.  
- Clear visualisations of key concepts: stochastic differential equation, replicating portfolio dynamics, convergence from discrete model to continuous limit.  
- Annotated code in the notebook linking each visual to the analytical derivation, enabling reproducibility and further experimentation.

This concise repo is designed to pair theory (in the PDF) with interactive visuals (in the notebook), enabling you to both follow the derivation and explore it dynamically.
